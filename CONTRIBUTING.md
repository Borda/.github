# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We appreciate all contributions and welcome everyone.

> **First time contributing to open source?** Check out [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) for a beginner-friendly guide.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to be respectful, considerate, and help create a welcoming environment for everyone.

## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute beyond writing code:

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 🐛 Report bugs | Found an issue? Let us know! |
| 📖 Improve docs | Fix typos, clarify explanations, add examples |
| 🔍 Triage issues | Help categorize and reproduce reported issues |
| 👀 Review PRs | Provide feedback on pull requests |
| 💬 Answer questions | Help others in discussions and issues |
| ⭐ Spread the word | Star the repo, share it, write about it |

## 💬 Before You Start

### Read First

- **Documentation** – Understand how the project works
- **Existing issues** – Your idea might already be discussed
- **Codebase** – Familiarize yourself with the code structure

### Ask Questions

Don't hesitate to ask! Open an issue or use discussions to:

- Clarify project goals and scope
- Understand implementation details
- Get guidance on where to contribute

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug:

1. **Search existing issues** – It might already be reported
2. **Create a minimal reproduction** – Help us help you
3. **Include environment details** – OS, version, dependencies
4. **Describe expected vs actual behavior** – Be specific

## 💡 Proposing Features

**Before implementing a feature:**

1. **Open an issue first** – Describe your idea and use case
2. **Wait for feedback** – Get confirmation from maintainers
3. **Discuss alternatives** – There might be better approaches

> ⚠️ **Important:** Always get confirmation before implementing new features. This ensures your work aligns with project direction and won't be wasted effort.

## 🔧 Pull Requests

### Before Opening a PR

Complete this checklist (also in the PR template):

- [ ] Self-reviewed my code
- [ ] Ran tests locally and they pass
- [ ] Added tests for new functionality
- [ ] Updated documentation if needed
- [ ] Followed existing code style
- [ ] Linked to related issue(s)

### Linking Issues

**Every PR should reference an issue.** Use keywords like:

- `Fixes #123` – Closes the issue when PR is merged
- `Relates to #456` – Links without auto-closing

If no issue exists, open one first to discuss the change.

### Keep PRs Focused

- One PR = one logical change
- Smaller PRs are easier to review
- Split large changes into multiple PRs

## ✅ Tests and Fixes

Bug fixes and test improvements are **always welcome**! These contributions:

- Improve project stability
- Help catch future regressions
- Reduce maintainer burden

When fixing bugs, include a test that would have caught it.

## ✨ Quality Expectations

> **Always do your best – that's the essential spirit of OSS contributions.**

We value all levels of contribution and want to encourage everyone, regardless of skill level or time available. What matters is being reasonable and meaningful about what you can deliver:

- **Start small and iterate** – Better to do smaller tasks piece by piece than take too much and leave it unfinished
- **Break work into steps** – This allows others to take over and continue if needed
- **Avoid abandoned PRs** – Forked PRs are difficult to carry over except by maintainers, creating significant burden
- **Be meaningful and reasonable** – Contribute what you can realistically complete

We don't expect perfection. We expect genuine effort. If you're unsure about something, ask!

## 🚀 Quick Start

# 1. Fork the repository

# 2. Clone your fork

# 3. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature

# 4. Make your changes, then commit
git commit -m "Add amazing feature"

# 5. Push to your fork
