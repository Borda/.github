# Contributing to This Project

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing! This guide will help you get started and ensure a smooth collaboration experience.

## 📖 Before You Start

**Please take time to:**

- **Read the documentation** – Familiarize yourself with how the project works
- **Explore the codebase** – Understand the structure and coding patterns used
- **Search existing issues** – Your question or idea might already be discussed

## 💬 Communication First

### Asking Questions

Before diving into code, feel free to ask questions! Open an issue or use discussions to:

- Clarify project goals and scope
- Understand implementation details
- Get guidance on where to contribute

### Feature Requests

**Before submitting a feature request:**

1. Check if a similar feature has been requested or discussed
2. Open an issue describing your idea and use case
3. **Wait for maintainer feedback** before starting implementation

> ⚠️ **Important:** Always get confirmation before implementing new features. This ensures your work aligns with the project direction and won't be wasted effort.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Tests

Bug fixes and test improvements are **always welcome**! These contributions help improve stability and are greatly appreciated.

When fixing bugs:

- Reference the related issue in your PR

## 🔗 Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Opening a PR

Please complete the following checklist (also described in the PR template):

- [ ] **Self-review** your code thoroughly

- [ ] **Follow code style** consistent with the project
- [ ] **Update documentation** if needed
- [ ] **Link related issues** using keywords like `Fixes #123` or `Relates to #456`

### Always Link Issues

Every PR should reference an existing issue. If there isn't one:
